## Univariate Visualization

A straightforward way to describe the distribution of a continuous variable is histogram
```{webr-r}
hist(sim_data$age_baseline, main = "Distribution of Age", xlab = "Age",
     col = "skyblue", border = "white")
```

We can add more descriptive statistics to the plot
```{webr-r}
hist(sim_data$age_baseline, main = "Distribution of Age", xlab = "Age",
     col = "skyblue", border = "white")
mean_age <- mean(sim_data$age_baseline)
abline(v = mean_age, col = "red", lwd = 2, lty = 2)
mtext(paste0("Mean = ", round(mean_age, 1)), side = 3, col = "red")
```


```{webr-r}
boxplot(sim_data$bmi, main = "Distribution of BMI", ylab = "BMI",
        col = "lightgreen")
```
```{webr-r}
plot(density(sim_data$sbp), main = "Density of Systolic BP",
     xlab = "SBP", col = "red", lwd = 2)
```

```{webr-r}
barplot(table(sim_data$center), col = "lightblue", main = "Participants by center")
```

```{webr-r}
pie(table(sim_data$physical_activity), main = "Physical Activity Distribution")
```
