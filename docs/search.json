When the true count is positive, the game is advantageous to the player. Otherwise, it is advantageous to the dealer.\n\nTrue count: An approximation of “the number of high cards (A and all cards with value 10) minus the number of low cards (all cards with value 2-6)” in a shoe with one deck.\nHi-Lo Bet spreading: The bet spreading implemented in this simulator is the following:\n\n– If true count is less than 0, don’t bet.\n– If true count is 0 or 1, bet 1 unit.\n– If true count is 2, bet 2 units.\n– If true count is 3, bet 4 units.\n– If true count is 4, bet 8 units.\n– If true count is greater or equal 5, bet 16 units.\nYou can enable this bet spreading by setting counting_cards = TRUE.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a data frame containing all information related to the player’s performance in a simulation with \\(10^4\\) rounds.
